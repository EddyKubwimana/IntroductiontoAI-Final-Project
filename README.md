## Model Components

The implemented model, referred to as `model_strong`, is designed to perform emotion recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) with attention mechanisms. Here is a breakdown of its key components:

## How It Works

The model processes input sequences through convolutional layers to capture spatial features, followed by recurrent layers with attention mechanisms to capture temporal dependencies. Global Average Pooling is used to reduce dimensionality, and dense layers provide the final classification.

**Audio Feature Extraction:**
- The deployment model takes audio as input.
- Utilizes signal processing techniques and pre-processing to extract relevant features from the audio signal.
- Extracted features, such as spectrogram representations or Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), serve as input to the emotion recognition model.

**Emotion Prediction:**
- The extracted features are fed into the trained CNN-LSTM model.
- The model analyzes the temporal and spatial patterns within the audio features.
- The final dense layers provide predictions for the speaker's emotions.

## Requirements

- TensorFlow (Assuming the code is using the TensorFlow backend)
- Numpy
- Other dependencies as required by your existing environment
